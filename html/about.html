OnPar is a system utilized by the Mississippi State University Institute of Golf (MSUIG).  The purpose of the system is to offer MSUIG Instructors an alternative way to help golf students improve their form and overall game.  MSUIG Instructors can use the system to analyze the golf stroke data of their golf students in great detail.<br><br>

The OnPar system offers instructors the option to view the data in a number of ways.  The Scores View displays details such as the golfers scores, putts, and distance for each hole of every round the golfer has uploaded.  The Map View displays the golfers path for each hole they have played.  The Distance View displays the distance achieved by use of each club the golfer has used in the form of a bar graph.  The Spread View displays a cluster of the golfers shots and their deviation from their intended aim.  The Statistics View allows an instructor to view a particular golf students progress over a period of time.  The data being analyzed is collected by a golf student stroke by stroke during their rounds.  The data is recorded through use of a mobile device and uploaded to the server at the golf house.<br><br>

The system was developed by the Mississippi State University Software Engineering Senior Design team.  <br><br>

Third party development tools include the following:  <br>JQuery 1.8.3 <br>Select2.js <br>JQGrid.js <br>HighCharts.js<br><br>
