Manual installation instructions

1. Copy OnPar files to /gsas on the web server file system structure.
For example, the UniServer Apache distribution stores files in /UniServer/www/. 
Place OnPar files in /UniServer/www/gsas.
	
2. Set up the database
In order to use OnPar, a MySQL database must be set up and configured 
in such a way that it is accessible to the web and mobile client apps.
	
The simplest manner is to use the mysql commands to set up the database. 
Let's start by creating the database and the username / password inside MySQL first:

  # mysql -u root -p
  Enter password: <Enter root user password>
  mysql> create database gsas;
  Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

  mysql> grant all privileges on gsas.* to gsas identified by 'pQMzSYAp';
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

  mysql> flush privileges;
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

  mysql> exit
  Bye
  #

Under certain curcumstances, you may need to run variations of the "grant"
command:
mysql> grant all privileges on gsas.* to gsas@localhost identified by 'pQMzSYAp';
   OR
mysql> grant all privileges on gsas.* to gsas@'%' identified by 'pQMzSYAp';

This has created an empty database called 'gsas', created a user named 
'gsas' with a password of 'pQMzSYAp', and given the 'gsas' user total 
permission over the 'gsas' database. 

3. Install the schema for the database

While the database is now set up, it isn't populated with the required internal 
formatting to be used with OnPar. To do so, execute the following command:

  # mysql -u root -p
  Enter password: <Enter root user password>
  mysql> use database gsas;
  Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

  mysql> source gsas.sql
  Query OK, 6 rows affected (0.00 sec)

  mysql> flush privileges;
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

  mysql> exit
  Bye
  #

While the output may vary, as long as "Query OK" is in the response,
the operation will be a success. With the source command, it may be
necessary to specify the full filepath where "gsas.sql" is stored.

4. You're finished!
Some web stack packages (like UniServer), are set up to prevent
non-localhost access to the web server by default. Please refer
to the documentation for your web server software on how to
adjust this to enable non-localhost access.
